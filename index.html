                    <p>I'm a software developer passionate about building seamless integrations. Currently shaping the future at <a href="https://bcity.me" target="_blank">Binary City</a>, I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant code.</p>

                        <h3><span>[1]</span> About me</h3>
                        <p>They say I'm a "software wizard." I prefer "code conjurer." I've been slinging code since before some of you were born. Okay, maybe not that long, but it feels like it. I've seen the tech world evolve from dial-up to downloading entire galaxies in seconds.</p>
                        <p>I'm the kind of guy who dreams in binary and sees the world as a giant, complex puzzle begging to be solved. I've built things, broken things, and rebuilt them even better. From the humble beginnings of a junior developer to bossing around teams and running my own show, I've done it all. But let's be real, the suit and tie life wasn't my jam. I'm happiest when I'm knee-deep in code, surrounded by error messages that are just puzzles waiting to be conquered.</p>
                        <p>I'm a bit of an oddball. I mean, I'm passionate about code, but I also have a soft spot for Hello Kitty. Don't judge me. And when I'm not conjuring digital magic, you might find me lost in the Star Trek universe, dreaming of boldly going where no code has gone before.</p>
                        <p>So, if you're looking for someone who can turn your wild ideas into reality, and maybe share a laugh over a Hello Kitty sticker while we're at it, I'm your guy. Let's create something awesome together.</p>

                                I built a service to hook up biometric devices with the cloud. Think of it as a digital handshake. To make this work, I created a super-fast, two-way communication channel using WebSockets. It's like having multiple conversations at once! I made sure everything ran smoothly by using multiple threads and caching data for quick access. It was a coding challenge, but I nailed it.

To make it all work smoothly, we used Active Directory as the big boss to keep everyone in line, even the ones hiding behind a VPN.

This means prices and pictures always stay up-to-date, and we never run out of stuff. It's like having a robot manage the store!

                <h3>Biometric Device Cloud Bridge</h3>
                <p>I built a bridge between biometric gadgets and the cloud.</p>

                <p>To make these two worlds chat in real-time, I set up a superfast messenger (WebSocket reverse proxy) that lets multiple services talk to each other without missing a beat. I worked hand-in-hand with the cloud crew to make sure managing those biometric devices was a breeze.</p>

                <p>Security is a big deal, so I locked down the service with AES encryption on top of SSL. We're talking bank-level safety here.</p>

                <p>To handle all the action, I created a super-efficient multi-threaded machine that can juggle lots of commands at once. And to keep things running smoothly, I added a smart memory cache. It's like having a super-fast assistant that remembers everything.</p>

                <p>I built a super-powered connector between <a href="https://www.zoho.com/" target="_blank">Zoho CRM, Workdrive,</a> and our main system.</p>

                <p>Imagine a high-speed data highway with traffic flowing both ways. That's what I created using Zoho Deluge. This magic bridge lets our main system talk to CRM and Workdrive in real-time, sharing info like crazy.</p>

                <p>We locked down the data with top-notch encryption to keep everything safe. This whole setup makes life easier for everyone, from the system to the people using it. It's like having a super-smart assistant that keeps everything organized and easy to find.</p>

                <h3>Bridging the Gap: Integrated Systems</h3>
                <p>I'm diving head first into a colossal puzzle of software integration. We're talking API, web app, CRM, investment platform, and Outlook - it's like herding cats, but with way more acronyms.</p> 
                
                <p>Getting these disparate systems to play nice is no small feat, especially when some are hiding behind a VPN. Active Directory is our digital traffic cop, trying to keep everyone in line. I'm the architect, building bridges between these systems and making sure data flows smoothly. It's a wild ride, but I'm loving the challenge.</p>

                <p>I  cooked up a super-flexible Windows service to make our API a real integration champ. It's like a magic translator that can talk to any other API, no matter what language they speak. This service is the ultimate connector, making it easy to hook up our API with all sorts of other systems.</p>

                <p>We built it to live on company computers, so it's perfect for connecting with internal tools. And because we know APIs can change their minds, we made a super-smart mapping system that can adapt to any language. This way, data flows smoothly without any drama.</p>

                <h3>Trade Facilitation Portal</h3>
                <p>I spearheaded the conceptualization and development of an innovative online platform designed to revolutionize trade processes in Namibia.</p>

                <p>Funded by <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank">USAID</a> and in close collaboration with the <a href="https://mfpe.gov.na/" target="_blank">Ministry of Finance</a> and Namibia Customs & Excise, this project demanded a deep understanding of the complex trade ecosystem.</p>

                <p>By integrating a robust classification system provided by 3CE, we've transformed the arduous task of HS code identification into a streamlined, user-friendly experience. This involved meticulous data mapping, algorithm development, and a user-centric design approach. The platform's ability to translate complex trade regulations into plain language has been instrumental in empowering Namibian traders and facilitating efficient customs clearance.</p>

                <h3>Enhancing E-commerce with Click-and-Collect</h3>
                <p>I cooked up a killer e-commerce platform with a Namibian twist. Click-and-collect? You betcha! To feed the online store, I built a high-speed data pipeline that sucks product info straight from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/introduction-to-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012" target="_blank">Microsoft Dynamics AX</a> and dumps it into the cloud. A trusty CRON job keeps everything in sync, so the website is always up-to-date and ready to rock.</p>

                <p>I also gave each store its own order-handling superpower. No more bottlenecks! This decentralized setup makes everyone's life easier. The result? A happy customer base and a business that runs like a well-oiled machine.</p>

                <h3>Rapid Legal Document Search</h3>
                <p>I engineered a high-performance document management system tailored for legal professionals. This web application tackles the challenge of efficiently navigating vast PDF repositories. At its core is a custom-built indexing engine that delivers lightning-fast search results. To streamline the ingestion process, I developed a user-friendly interface that simplifies document upload and categorization.</p>

                <p>But the real magic happens in the search algorithm. By analyzing user behavior and engagement, the system intelligently adapts search results over time, providing increasingly accurate and relevant findings. This, combined with sophisticated weighting systems, ensures that users find the information they need, when they need it. Think of it as a legal research assistant on steroids.</p>

                <h3>Enhancing Digital Accessibility</h3>
                <p>I engineered a comprehensive digital platform for the <a href="https://www.namra.org.na/" target="_blank">Namibian Revenue Agency (NamRA)</a> in partnership with <a href="https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/323.html" target="_blank">GIZ</a>. With a strong focus on accessibility, we integrated robust text-to-speech capabilities and customizable user controls. To enhance user experience and efficiency, we implemented an intelligent search function that learns user behavior to deliver highly personalized results.</p>
                <p>A standout feature is the interactive virtual assistant, designed to provide real-time tax guidance. By combining engaging SVG animations with dynamic JavaScript interactions, we created a virtual agent capable of answering common queries, offering tailored tax advice, and guiding users through the platform. This project was a blend of technical expertise and user-centric design, resulting in a robust and intuitive digital solution.</p>

                <p>I engineered a culinary discovery platform that redefines the recipe search experience.</p>

                <p>By focusing on ingredient-based queries, we've transformed the way users interact with recipe content. Our platform empowers users to unlock culinary potential by providing a flexible search interface that accommodates various dietary restrictions, ingredient preferences, and leftovers.</p>

                <p>At the heart of the application is a sophisticated ingredient indexing system that I developed from the ground up. This engine meticulously categorizes and analyzes ingredients, enabling lightning-fast and highly accurate search results. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data structures, we've created a robust and scalable solution that delivers exceptional user experiences.</p>
