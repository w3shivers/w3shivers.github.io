                    <h2>I'm the glue that holds your tech together.</h2>
                    <p>I'm a software developer passionate about building seamless integrations. Currently shaping the future at <a href="https://bcity.me" target="_blank">Binary City</a>, I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant code.</p>

                        <h3><span>[1]</span> About me</h3>
                        <p>They say I'm a "software wizard." I prefer "code conjurer." I've been slinging code since before some of you were born. Okay, maybe not that long, but it feels like it. I've seen the tech world evolve from dial-up to downloading entire galaxies in seconds.</p>
                        <p>I'm the kind of guy who dreams in binary and sees the world as a giant, complex puzzle begging to be solved. I've built things, broken things, and rebuilt them even better. From the humble beginnings of a junior developer to bossing around teams and running my own show, I've done it all. But let's be real, the suit and tie life wasn't my jam. I'm happiest when I'm knee-deep in code, surrounded by error messages that are just puzzles waiting to be conquered.</p>
                        <p>I'm a bit of an oddball. I mean, I'm passionate about code, but I also have a soft spot for Hello Kitty. Don't judge me. And when I'm not conjuring digital magic, you might find me lost in the Star Trek universe, dreaming of boldly going where no code has gone before.</p>
                        <p>So, if you're looking for someone who can turn your wild ideas into reality, and maybe share a laugh over a Hello Kitty sticker while we're at it, I'm your guy. Let's create something awesome together.</p>
